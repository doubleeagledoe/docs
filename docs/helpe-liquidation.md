# Liquidation

#### 1. What is liquidation?
Liquidation is a process that occurs when the borrower's health factor is lower than 1, because its collateral value cannot properly cover its loan / debt value. This may occur when the value of collateral decreases or when the value of borrowed debt increases with each other. The ratio of collateral to loan value is shown in the health factor.
In the liquidation, 100% liquidation will be carried out to pay all the debts of the borrower, and the value + liquidation fee will be withdrawn from the available collateral. Therefore, after liquidation, the amount liquidated from your debt will be repaid.

#### 2. How to avoid liquidation?
You can avoid paying off more of your assets by depositing or liquidating more of your assets. By default, repayment can increase your health factor more than deposit. In addition, it is important to monitor your health factor and keep it high to avoid liquidation. For example, keeping your health factor above 2 will give you more room to avoid liquidation.
