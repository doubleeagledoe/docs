# Borrowings And Repayments

#### 1. LTV interpretation 
The loan to value (LTV) ratio is the financial term of the value ratio of the collateral of the lender's express loan. In other words, the measurement of the loan balance relative to the value of the mortgaged assets is expressed as the loan to value ratio (LTV).
Traditional lenders (such as banks) use your credit score (reported by third-party credit institutions) to determine your reputation. The higher your credit score, the lower the lender's risk.
LTV is calculated as a percentage of the dollar loan amount divided by the dollar collateral value.
example:
Loan amount: USD 5.000;
Collateral value: $10.000;
LTV = ($5.000 / $10.000) * 100% = 50.0%

#### 2. What is the loan to value ratio of my assets?
The loan to value (LTV) ratio is an indicator of the size of the loan compared to the asset value of the secured loan.
The percentage of loan value of each asset is dynamically determined by the DoubleEagle blockchain Oracle algorithm, which depends on the current and historical volatility of the asset and market liquidity.
These are the current loan to value ratios supported by our cryptocurrency:
DOE-50%
BNB-70%
ETH-70%
BTC-70%
CAKE-70%
USDT-70%

#### 9. How much can I borrow?
The maximum amount you can borrow depends on the value of your deposit and the liquidity available. For example, if you don't have enough liquidity or your health factors don't allow you to borrow, you can't borrow. You can find the specific parameters of each available collateral and its borrowing in the risk parameters section.

#### 10. What assets do I need to repay?
You repay your loan with the same assets you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 doe, you will repay 1 DOE + accrued interest.

#### 11. How much interest do I have to pay?
The interest rate you pay for borrowing assets depends on the borrowing interest rate, which is derived from the supply-demand ratio of assets. Moreover, the interest rate of variable interest rate is constantly changing, and a stable interest rate provides stability for interest rate. You can find the current borrowing rate in the borrowing section of the dashboard at any time.

#### 12. What is the health coefficient?
Health factor is a digital representation of the security of deposit assets relative to borrowed assets and their underlying value. The higher the value, the safer your capital status in case of liquidation.  

#### 13. What happens when my health decreases?
According to the fluctuation of the value of deposits, health factors will increase or decrease. If your health factor increases, it will improve your borrowing situation and make the liquidation threshold more unlikely to be reached. If the value of mortgaged assets relative to borrowed assets decreases, health factors will also decrease, resulting in increased liquidation risk.  

#### 14. When will I repay the loan?
There is no fixed term for repayment of the loan. As long as your health coefficient is safe, you can borrow an uncertain period. However, over time, accrued interest will increase, reducing your health factors, which may make your deposit assets more likely to be liquidated.
